## ESN Luxembourg

### Motivation for this Organization Profile
Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is a non-profit international student organisation. Our mission is to represent international students, thus provide opportunities for cultural understanding and self-development under the principle of Students Helping Students. In Europe there are local ESN sections at more than 500 higher education facilities in more than 45 countries. This makes us one of the largest student initiatives in Europe.
As Luxembourgs own section, we provide several different activities to international students, such as simple gatherings, day trips or weekend trips in the region in and around Luxembourg.
This profile is made for all IT related projects and contains the source code for the website (we don't use Satellite!), and further projects like Event Management Systems and potential Apps
